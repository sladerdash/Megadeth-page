hi, this is just to tell you that the "index.htlm" file (wich does´nt have a particular name for no reason)
it´s just a personal proyect i did (probably im still doing) introducing the things im learning in the free
coding course of "WWW.FreeCodeCamp.com", chatgpt (only when im really having problems), and youtube tutorials,
so don´t spect to watch a good page from the first time.
a days back i got the notice that megadeth´ll separate in 2026... i hope i have the same luck as 2023 to watch
their perform, at least to look at the one last time
note: i still need to learn javascript to make the page be "alive", btw i see that you can animate with css,
but it must be something like programing games with python, you can? yes, is it recommend? hell na.
hope you like this proyect date=(17/8/2025)
